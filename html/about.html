                <h1>Benjamin Humphrey</h1>

                <p>I’m a 25 year old product designer living in Sydney, Australia. I prefer stories to resumés with bullet points, so this is a short story about me.</p>
                                
                <p>I studied Computer Science &amp; Design at the <a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/" target="_blank">University of Otago</a> for a couple of years before co–founding a media company in 2009. We created sites like <a href="http://omgubuntu.co.uk" target="_blank">OMG! Ubuntu!</a> and <a href="http://omgchrome.com" target="_blank">OMG! Chrome!</a> which now have a combined reader base of around 500,000.</p>

                <p>Looking for something new, I freelanceed for <a href="http://www.sportnz.org.nz/" target="_blank">Sport New Zealand</a> where I worked on a web app for athletes &amp; teams to share training resources. Around the same time I helped <a href="https://www.pocketsmith.com/" target="_blank">PocketSmith</a> with user interface design.</p> 

                <p>In 2011 I joined a small web design agency called Loop as the sole designer. I worked on web design for a bunch of prominent clients in New Zealand, as well as our product called Jigsoar.</p>

                <p>Just as Jigsoar was coming out of beta, the four of us at Loop were acquired by the founders of YouTube, Chad Hurley and Steve Chen. Their company AVOS (now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MixBit" target="_blank">Mixbit</a>) is headquarted in Silicon Valley, however they opened an office in New Zealand for us.</p>

                <p>I spent three months in the bay area, initially working on a product called <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/zeen-avos-youtube-cofounders-project-walkthrough-2012-8#exciting-heres-our-invite-1" target="_blank">Zeen</a>. I then took up the position of Design Lead for <a href="http://delicious.com/" target="_blank">Delicious</a> where I led our early 2013 <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/10/3864010/delicious-completely-redesigned-social-bookmarking-service" target="_blank">redesign and frontend rewrite</a>, and designed new iOS and Android apps.</p>

                <p>In March 2013 I accepted an offer to join <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian</a> in Sydney. I took seven weeks off before relocating from New Zealand, and in this time I started a design conference called <a href="https://github.com/humphreybc/uxdesignday-resources" target="_blank">UX Design Day</a> which has had successful events in <a href="http://www.designassembly.org.nz/articles/ux-design-wellington" target="_blank">Wellington</a> and <a href="http://www.designassembly.org.nz/articles/ux-design-day-dunedin" target="_blank">Dunedin</a>.</p>

                <p>Over the past two years at Atlassian I’ve worked on the JIRA design team, contributed to a brand project, created new patterns for our <a href="https://design.atlassian.com/latest/" target="_blank">visual design and UI pattern library</a>, and more.</p>

                <p>At the moment I’m a Senior Designer on the Growth Team, where we run A/B experiments and usability tests on our products like JIRA, Confluence, HipChat, and Bitbucket. I help brainstorm, design, analyse, and derive lessons from these tests, and encourage other designers to embrace growth techniques in their day–to–day work.</p>

                <p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/humphreybc" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/humphreybc" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/humphreybc/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and of course my personal site right here. Thanks for reading and have a great <span id="time">day</span>!</p>
