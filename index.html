    <p>I’m a product designer living in Sydney, Australia. I prefer stories to resumés with bullet points, so this is a short story about me.</p>
                    
    <p>I studied Computer Science &amp; Design at the University of Otago for a couple of years before co–founding a media company in 2009. We created sites like OMG! Ubuntu! and OMG! Chrome! which now have a combined reader base of around 500,000.</p>

    <p>Looking for something new, I freelanceed for Sport New Zealand where I worked on a web app for athletes &amp; teams to share training resources. Around the same time I helped PocketSmith with user interface design.</p> 

    <p>In 2011 I joined a small web design agency called Loop as the sole designer. I worked on web design for a bunch of prominent clients in New Zealand, as well as our product called Jigsoar.</p>

    <p>Just as Jigsoar was coming out of beta, the four of us at Loop were acquired by the founders of YouTube, Chad Hurley and Steve Chen. Their company AVOS (now known as Mixbit) is headquarted in Silicon Valley, however they opened an office in New Zealand for us.</p>

    <p>I spent three months in the bay area, initially working on a product called Zeen. I then took up the position of Design Lead for Delicious where I led our early 2013 redesign and frontend rewrite, and designed new iOS and Android apps.</p>

    <p>In March 2013 I accepted an offer to join Atlassian in Sydney. I took seven weeks off before relocating from New Zealand, and in this time I started a design conference called UX Design Day which has had successful events in Wellington and Dunedin.</p>
